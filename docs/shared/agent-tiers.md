# Agent Tiers

This file defines practical tier guidance for OMX agent routing.

## Tiers

- `LOW`:
  Fast lookups and narrow checks.
  Use for simple exploration, style checks, and lightweight doc edits.
  Typical roles: `explore`, `style-reviewer`, `writer`.

- `STANDARD`:
  Default tier for implementation, debugging, and normal verification.
  Typical roles: `executor`, `debugger`, `test-engineer`, `quality-reviewer`.

- `THOROUGH`:
  Use for architectural, security-sensitive, or high-impact multi-file work.
  Typical roles: `architect`, `critic`, `security-reviewer`, `executor`.
  Note: `deep-executor` is deprecated; route implementation to `executor`.

## Selection Rules

1. Start at `STANDARD` for most code changes.
2. Use `LOW` only when the task is bounded and non-invasive.
3. Escalate to `THOROUGH` for:
   - security/auth/trust-boundary changes
   - architectural decisions with system-wide impact
   - large refactors across many files
4. For Ralph completion checks, use at least `STANDARD` architect verification.
